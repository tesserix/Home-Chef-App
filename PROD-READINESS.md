# Home Chef Vendor App — Production Readiness Plan

**Target:** Open public launch in 8 weeks (start: 2026-06-05, ship: ~2026-07-31)
**Execution:** Solo dev (Mahesh) + Claude subagents
**Scope:** vendor-mobile + homechef-api + supporting infra. **Customer app (Wave 6)**, **delivery via 3PL — own fleet retired (Wave 7)**, and **tesserix-home admin integration (Wave 5B)** are captured below for separate implementation sessions.

## Progress snapshot (last updated 2026-06-11)

| Wave | Application code | Operational |
|---|---|---|
| Wave 1 (Foundation) | **✅ 100%** — Sentry + force-upgrade gate + rate-limit + idempotency + webhook HMAC + Dependabot (88→28 vulns) + base-image Go 1.26.4 stopgap | ⏳ TestFlight, APNs cert, Sentry DSN secrets, Cloudflare WAF, Cloud SQL drill |
| Wave 2 (Critical workflows) | **✅ 100% in-scope (9/9 backend, 12/13 mobile)** — cancel flows, doc renewal, notif prefs + FCM topics, info_requested email, FSSAI cron, FSSAI inputs, **pause-receiving with auto-resume** | ⏳ FoSCoS API access (external) |
| Wave 3 (Financial + tax) | **✅ 100% in-scope (9/9 backend, 6/6 mobile)** — GSTIN + HSN, invoice PDF, refund, auto-email, DPDP, weekly statements + cron, TDS 16A, refund history, settlement reconciliation | ⏳ Privacy policy + EULA URLs (legal) |
| Wave 4 (Launch polish + scale) | **✅ codeable items done** — OTel→Cloud Trace, structured logging + correlation IDs, audit log, pool tuning, automaxprocs (min-scale:1 already set); deep links, EAS OTA, i18n+Hindi+locale picker; runbook/on-call/status/concierge docs | ⏳ App Store enrollment+submission, full a11y/bundle QA (needs build), auth-bff OTel |

**51 commits on `main`** since 2026-06-05 (~14 this session: Wave 3 close-out + Wave 4 + Wave 2 pause-receiving). Check `git log --oneline` for the full trail.

## Assumptions

- India-only launch. Multi-region deferred to v2.
- GKE Autopilot infra stays as-is. No platform migration.
- Cloud SQL `db-f1-micro` stays. No HA/replicas until traffic justifies (≥100 chefs).
- Sentry (free tier 5k errors/mo) for crash reporting on both mobile + backend.
- Will switch ONE service to `minScale: 1` (auth-bff) — others stay scale-to-zero.
- Trivy gate flips from warn-only to fail-on-critical in Wave 1.
- 4 waves × 2 weeks each. Each wave ships independently and is testable end-to-end.

## Locked deferrals (v2, NOT in scope)

- Customer app — now IN scope, see **Wave 6** (separate session)
- **Own delivery fleet / driver app** — RETIRED. Deliveries go through 3PL providers (Shadowfax-class). See **Wave 7**.
- Multi-staff / sub-chef permissions
- Multi-kitchen locations
- Menu customizations + modifiers + combos
- Promo / discount codes
- Loyalty / referral program
- Chef community forum
- Time-windowed item availability
- Read replicas / multi-region
- E-invoicing (>₹5cr turnover) — none of our beta chefs will hit threshold

## Platform integration — tesserix-home + tickets (planned)

The admin↔vendor loop spans two surfaces; the vendor app holds only the chef-facing half.

- [ ] **Platform-admin approval UI in `tesserix-home`** — admins review/approve/`info_requested` against the existing chef approval API (`/admin/...`, `RequireAdmin`). The vendor app keeps its **Admin Requests** page as the chef's *respond* surface (`GET /chef/admin-requests` + `PUT /chef/admin-requests/:id/respond`) — do NOT remove it; it's the chef side of this flow.
- [x] **Vendor support/feature tickets** — chefs raise platform issues + feature requests from the vendor app (2026-06-11). Mobile: `hooks/useSupport.ts` + `app/support/{index,new,[id]}.tsx` + `components/vendor/TicketStatus{Chip,Stepper}.tsx` + More-tab entry, wired to the existing Home Chef `/api/v1/support/tickets` API (4-stage stepper, Uber-monochrome). Full create→reply→close cycle verified live. Admin triage UI lives in tesserix-home (still pending — see Platform integration).
- [x] **Vendor cover image** — `bannerImage` upload in vendor profile (`POST /chef/banner-image`) + customer `ChefCard` hero now prefers the cover (banner → kitchen photo → avatar). Backend + model already supported it; this session added the vendor upload UI + flipped the customer hero ordering.
- [ ] **Chef payout/settlement admin in `tesserix-home`** — admins view + configure **all** chefs' payouts (weekly settlement statements, net payouts, status, commission %, schedule). The **chef-facing half is DONE** in the vendor app (Earnings → Statements + settlement-statement PDF + TDS cert; `GET /chef/statements/weekly`, `/chef/earnings/breakdown`, `/chef/payout`). Admin oversight + actual disbursement land with the tesserix-home batch — see Wave 5B.
- Future (deferred): **OCR** to pre-fill FSSAI license number + expiry on doc re-upload (chef confirms/edits) — see the doc-reupload decision.

## Risks (and what eats which wave)

| Risk | Eats |
|---|---|
| Razorpay account onboarding for chefs blocked / slow | W3 |
| FoSCoS API integration delay | W2 |
| App Store review rejection (privacy, payment policy) | W4 |
| Cloud SQL connection-pool exhaustion at scale | needs W4 mitigation |
| GIP rate limits during onboarding burst | W1 |

---

## Wave 1 — Foundation (weeks 1–2)

**Goal:** Cannot ship without these. Make the system observable, securable, distributable.

### Mobile
- [ ] **TestFlight pipeline** — App Store Connect setup, distribution cert, `eas submit` flow, internal testing group _(blocked: Apple Developer enrollment)_
- [x] **Sentry** integration (`@sentry/react-native` + Expo plugin), source-maps upload on EAS build _(scaffold shipped — needs `EAS_SECRET_SENTRY_DSN/AUTH_TOKEN/ORG` set)_
- [x] **Force-upgrade gate** — `min_version` from API, hard wall + App Store link (`/upgrade-required` screen + axios 426 handler + useMinVersion polling)
- [x] **Privacy manifests** (iOS 17+) — `app.json` `ios.privacyManifests` declares 4 API categories + 7 data types
- [ ] **APNs production cert** in Firebase + EAS credentials _(blocked: Firebase + Apple Dev console access)_
- [x] **Bundle ID + signing certs** finalized for production profile in EAS _(eas.json `submit.production.ios` configured; cert upload pending)_

### Backend
- [x] **Sentry-go** integration on `homechef-api` (gated on `SENTRY_DSN_API`; panics + 5xx capture, 10% trace sample) _(auth-bff same recipe pending)_
- [x] **Rate limiting middleware** — Redis token-bucket, per chef (auth user_id) + per IP. `60req/min` chef, `30req/min` unauth. Fail-open on Redis down. X-RateLimit-* headers.
- [x] **Idempotency-Key** middleware on POST/PUT/PATCH mutations — Redis-backed, 24h TTL, opt-in via header
- [x] **Razorpay webhook signature verification** — audit complete (Razorpay+Stripe were already verified; delivery provider webhook HMAC added)
- [x] **Dependabot triage** — partial: 88 → 28 vulns (60-vuln reduction via pnpm overrides + x/net bump); 6 Go stdlib remain pending base-image rebuild
- [ ] **Trivy gate flip** — from warn-only to fail on critical+high once Dependabot is clean _(blocked: 6 remaining critical/high)_

### Infra
- [ ] **Cloud SQL automated backups + restore drill** — verify retention policy, run a non-prod restore, document RTO/RPO _(operational)_
- [x] **`min_scale: 1` on auth-bff** — confirmed already satisfied (auth-bff is Deployment+KEDA at 2/2 replicas, not Knative; flagged in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-05-wave1-infra-design.md` §8)
- [ ] **Cloudflare WAF rules** — managed ruleset on `*.fe3dr.com`, custom rules for `/auth/auto-login` brute force _(operational; Pro plan needed)_

### Definition of done
- A real device installs via TestFlight (single chef test)
- Any panic in either Go service shows up in Sentry within 30s
- A 70-req/min flood from one IP gets HTTP 429 after the first 60
- `gh run list` shows no failing builds; Trivy gate is fail-on-critical
- Cold-start 503 on auth-bff is reproducibly gone (load test)

### Parallelization
- Subagent A (mobile): TestFlight + Sentry + force-upgrade + privacy manifests
- Subagent B (backend): Sentry + rate limit + idempotency + webhook verification
- Subagent C (deps): Dependabot sweep + Trivy gate
- Infra tasks (Cloud SQL + min_scale + WAF) — sequential, by hand, ~half-day

---

## Wave 2 — Critical chef workflows (weeks 3–4)

**Goal:** A real chef can run a full week of orders without needing manual ops intervention.

### Mobile
- [x] **FSSAI expiry date picker** on docs step (onboarding) — TextInput w/ YYYY-MM-DD format validation, sent as `expiryDate` multipart field on FSSAI upload
- [x] **Doc renewal screen** for verified chefs (`/documents/renew`) — list docs with expiry status, swap file (camera/gallery/PDF) → `POST /chef/documents/:id/replace`
- [x] **Admin-requests inbox** — dashboard "ACTION REQUIRED" card + `/admin-requests` list with status badges + `/admin-requests/[id]` detail
- [x] **Approval-request response flow** — chef replies with text + optional file attach; sends to `PUT /chef/admin-requests/:id/respond`
- [x] **Order partial fulfillment + cancellation** — TWO affordances on the accepted-order detail screen:
  - [x] **Per-line "Can't fulfill this item"** — backend partial-refunds the line + atomically recomputes order totals; mobile renders cancelled lines with strikethrough + "Refunded ₹X" badge
  - [x] **Whole-order cancel** with reason picker (iOS ActionSheet + Android chained Alert)
- [x] **Pause receiving with auto-resume** — dashboard status pill → Open / Close / Pause {15,30,60} min menu; `PausedUntil` on chef_profiles + `POST /chef/availability/pause|resume` + 1-min auto-resume cron (reopens + push); shows "Back HH:MM"
- [x] **Menu item image upload UI** — already wired pre-session via `MenuItemForm.handlePickPhoto` → `useUploadMenuPhoto` → `POST /chef/menu/items/:id/images`
- [x] **Reviews list / inbox** — `app/reviews.tsx` with adapter fix (was crashing on wire shape) + `/chef/reviews/summary` for averageRating
- [x] **Notification preferences screen** — `app/notification-preferences.tsx` with toggles + quiet hours + optimistic save; backend FCM topic reconcile on each flip

### Bonus (not in original spec)
- [x] **FSSAI license number capture** — 14-digit TextInput in onboarding, persisted to new `chef_profiles.fssai_license_number` column (unblocks Wave 3 invoicing + future FoSCoS lookup)
- [x] **More tab nav** — discoverable entries for admin-requests, documents/renew, notification-preferences

### Backend
- [x] **`POST /chef/orders/:id/cancel`** with reason enum — full Razorpay refund + status → `cancelled` + NATS `order.cancelled` event. Idempotent on retry.
- [x] **`POST /chef/orders/:id/items/:itemId/cancel`** with reason — partial Razorpay refund (line subtotal + proportional tax share); atomic GORM transaction for line flip + order recompute; order status stays accepted/preparing
- [x] **`is_cancelled` + `cancelled_reason` + `refund_id` + `cancelled_at` + `refund_amount` columns** on `order_items` via AutoMigrate
- [x] **Razorpay partial refund** — `services.GetRazorpay().CreateRefund` already existed; wired into both cancel paths
- [x] **`POST /chef/documents/:id/replace`** — atomic file URL + (optional) expiry + status flip to `pending`; cancels in-flight approval and creates a fresh one
- [x] **`GET /chef/notification-preferences` + `PUT`** — new `chef_notification_preferences` table; defaults applied when no row exists
- [x] **FCM topic subscriptions** wired to preferences — `services.SubscribeToFCMTopic` / `UnsubscribeFromFCMTopic` via Firebase IID API; reconciles on each PUT diff
- [x] **Email notification on info_requested approval** — `EmailService.SendApprovalInfoRequested` fires inline with the existing NATS event publish
- [x] **FSSAI expiry cron** — `services.StartFSSAIReminderCron` launched from `main.go`; 24h ticker, Redis-deduped via SETNX (26h TTL), fail-open on Redis down; fires push at 30/15/7 day windows

### Compliance
- [ ] **FSSAI validation** — `FoSCoS` API integration _(external dep — manual review queue is the fallback per risk callout)_

### Definition of done
- A chef whose FSSAI expires next month gets a banner + push at 30 days
- A chef can re-upload an expired doc and the system flips them back to `pending_review`
- A chef cancels an accepted order and the customer's full refund is in-flight within 10s
- A chef marks 1 of 2 items as "can't fulfill" → that line's refund is in-flight within 10s, order subtotal/tax/total recompute correctly, the other item continues prep
- A chef who toggles "no promo pings" stops getting promo pushes within one cycle

### Parallelization
- Subagent A (mobile): FSSAI date picker + doc renewal + admin inbox + approval response
- Subagent B (mobile): order cancellation + pause auto-resume + image upload + reviews list + notif prefs
- Subagent C (backend): all 5 backend tickets + cron job
- Compliance is single-thread (FoSCoS integration is a research + paperwork lift)

---

## Wave 3 — Financial + tax (weeks 5–6)

**Goal:** A chef can run their accounting for the quarter from inside the app. Legally sufficient invoices to customers.

### Mobile
- [x] **GSTIN capture** on chef profile (optional) — 15-char auto-uppercase TextInput in onboarding, sent to `/chef/onboarding`
- [x] **HSN code per menu item** — 8-digit numeric TextInput in MenuItemForm, defaults to 996331 server-side when blank
- [x] **Earnings → Statements section** — lists issued weekly statements, tap → downloads settlement PDF (shared `lib/download-pdf` helper)
- [x] **Earnings → Tax certificates** — TDS-certificate download row (current FY) on Earnings
- [x] **Order detail → Download invoice (PDF)** — `expo-file-system/legacy` + `expo-sharing`; auth'd fetch → system share sheet; surfaced on delivered orders
- [x] **Customer invoice auto-email** — backend hooks `order.delivered` NATS event, generates PDF, sends SendGrid attachment to customer
- [x] **Refund history view** on Earnings — Refunds section, one entry per refunded order (item breakdown), tap → opens order

### Backend
- [x] **`GET /chef/statements/weekly`** — lists immutable `WeeklyStatement` rows; `GET /chef/statements/:id/statement.pdf` streams the maroto settlement PDF
- [x] **`GET /chef/tax/certificate?year=FY`** — annual §194-O TDS summary (Form 16A style, quarterly breakdown, PAN/deductor block, TRACES disclaimer)
- [x] **`GET /orders/:id/invoice.pdf`** — customer-facing GSTIN invoice via `services.GenerateOrderInvoicePDF` (maroto v0.46)
- [x] **`GET /chef/orders/:orderId/invoice.pdf`** — chef-side copy of the same invoice _(bonus)_
- [x] **`POST /chef/orders/:id/refund`** with amount + reason — post-delivery goodwill refund (distinct from in-flight cancel); idempotent via remaining-balance check
- [x] **`GET /chef/refunds`** — refund history (authoritative `Order.RefundAmount`, no double-count vs per-line)
- [x] **GSTIN + HSN fields** on `chef_profiles` and `menu_items` respectively
- [x] **Weekly statement generation cron** — daily Mon–Sun IST close → immutable statement + push; idempotent (Redis SETNX + unique index); shared earnings math extracted to `services` with unit tests

### Compliance
- [x] **DPDP Act 2023** compliance pass — `GET /chef/me/export` (JSON dump of all chef data) + `POST /chef/me/delete` (soft-delete + 30d retention, requires email confirmation)
- [ ] **Privacy policy + EULA URLs** finalized + linked from app _(legal artifact)_
- [x] **Stripe/Razorpay settlement reconciliation** — daily cron cross-checks previous IST day's payments vs gateways (capture status + refund-amount drift), read-only, ERROR log + Sentry alert

### Definition of done
- Chef downloads weekly statement → opens cleanly in any PDF reader, line-itemized
- Customer receives a GSTIN-formatted invoice email within 5 min of delivery
- A test refund is reflected in chef's earnings within 1 hour
- `/chef/me/export` returns a zip of all chef data (DPDP requirement)

### Parallelization
- Subagent A (mobile): GSTIN/HSN capture + statements tab + tax certs + invoice download
- Subagent B (backend): PDF generation endpoints (3 of them) + refund flow + cycle close cron
- Compliance is sequential (legal review needed on DPDP + privacy policy)

---

## Wave 4 — Launch polish + scale (weeks 7–8)

**Goal:** Smooth public launch. App Store submission. India-vernacular reach. Observability for the support pager.

### Mobile
- [x] **i18n setup** — `react-i18next` + `expo-localization`, device-locale detection + AsyncStorage persistence (`lib/i18n.ts`)
- [x] **Hindi translation** — `en`/`hi` resource bundles for chef-facing strings; More tab migrated to `t()` as the reference _(full per-screen string coverage is mechanical/incremental from here)_
- [x] **Locale picker** in More tab — System / English / हिन्दी (`app/language.tsx`), auto-detects device locale
- [x] **Deep links** — `homechef-vendor://` scheme + push tap-through generalized across all categories (order/FSSAI/statement/availability) via `resolvePushRoute` + cold-start replay
- [x] **OTA updates** via EAS Update — `expo-updates` + `updates.url` (u.expo.dev), `appVersion` runtimeVersion policy, Hermes locked; `production`/`preview` channels in eas.json
- [~] **Bundle size audit** — Hermes engine locked (`jsEngine: hermes`); the size *measurement* + asset-compression pass needs a production build _(QA — run on a build)_
- [~] **Accessibility pass** — all new components ship with `accessibilityRole`/`Label`; full VoiceOver sweep + contrast audit needs the app running on device _(QA)_
- [ ] **App Store screenshots + listing** for IN store _(blocked: needs Apple Dev account + built app)_
- [ ] **App Store submission + review wait** _(blocked: Apple Developer enrollment)_

### Backend
- [x] **OpenTelemetry tracing** — `homechef-api` TracerProvider + Cloud Trace exporter (graceful no-op without creds, ratio sampler via `OTEL_SAMPLING_RATE`), otelgin span-per-request + trace_id bridged into logs _(auth-bff still pending — separate repo)_
- [x] **Structured logging with correlation IDs** — slog JSON `logger` pkg + `X-Request-ID` middleware + structured access log; trace_id joined in
- [x] **Audit log for sensitive mutations** — `LogAudit` wired into payout updates, doc downloads (invoice/statement/TDS), approval responses, order cancel/item-cancel/refund, DPDP delete; indexed `CorrelationID` on `audit_logs` (PII-safe)
- [x] **`min_scale: 1` on homechef-api** — verified already set in prod (min-scale 1, max-scale 10); keeps a warm pod + makes the crons reliable
- [x] **Connection pool tuning** — right-sized to env-configurable 20/5 + `ConnMaxIdleTime` (was an unsafe 100/10 on the shared db-f1-micro)
- [x] **`gomaxprocs`** — `go.uber.org/automaxprocs` aligns GOMAXPROCS with the Knative CPU limit

### Launch ops
- [x] **Runbook** for top-5 incident types — `docs/ops/RUNBOOK.md` (auth-bff / DB-pool / Razorpay / GIP / Knative + cron health)
- [x] **On-call** paging policy (solo) — `docs/ops/ON-CALL.md` (P1 page triggers vs. P2 morning)
- [x] **Status page** plan at `status.fe3dr.com` — `docs/ops/STATUS-PAGE.md` _(hosting setup is operational)_
- [x] **First-10-chefs concierge script** — `docs/ops/CONCIERGE.md`

### Definition of done
- App is live on App Store IN region
- Hindi locale renders all chef-facing copy without truncation
- A trace from a chef's tap on "Accept order" reaches the DB write in Cloud Trace
- 10 real chefs onboarded with concierge support, zero critical bugs in 48h
- Runbook is tested (drill the auth-bff-down scenario at least once)

### Parallelization
- Subagent A (mobile): i18n + Hindi + deep links + OTA + accessibility
- Subagent B (mobile): bundle audit + App Store screenshots + submission flow
- Subagent C (backend): OTel + structured logs + audit log + scale tuning
- Launch ops + runbook + concierge — single-thread, by hand

---

## Wave 5 — Platform consolidation (added 2026-06-10, runs parallel to W4 ops; ships after App Store approval)

**Goal:** Mobile-first like Uber — the web apps go away in favor of a single landing page with
store links, and Home Chef becomes a first-class Tesserix product visible in tesserix-home.

### 5A. Web sunset → landing page

- [x] **Landing page** at `fe3dr.com` — **BUILT + DEPLOYED LIVE 2026-06-11.** New `apps/web-landing` (Next.js 16 static export), Airbnb-**coral** consumer palette (owner chose coral over persimmon), Geist/Inter, authentic **Indian** home-cooking imagery (Pune launch), scroll-driven motion (signature animated order-route, parallax, dish marquee, FSSAI marks), live App/Play store badges (placeholder URLs — TODO), SEO (metadata/OG/sitemap/robots/JSON-LD), a11y AA. Deployed into the **existing `homechef-web` slot** (same GHCR image + ArgoCD app + fe3dr.com routing, port 80) via new `homechef-web-landing-build.yml` CI → no routing/DNS change. Old `apps/web` SPA de-wired (docker-compose + CI removed, `SUNSET.md`, dir kept). `vendors.fe3dr.com` API host verified unaffected (401 = alive). See [[project_ios_native_build_from_source]]-style memory `web-sunset-app-only`.
  - ⏳ Follow-ups: real store-listing URLs + official badge artwork; lawyer-reviewed legal content for `/privacy`,`/terms`,`/refund` stubs; owned photography + 1200×630 OG image; chef-onboarding link (currently `mailto:`).
- [ ] **Decommission `apps/vendor-portal` + `apps/delivery-portal` web UIs** — remove deployments; `vendors.fe3dr.com` / `delivery.fe3dr.com` web routes 301 → landing.
  - ⚠️ **`vendors.fe3dr.com` is the mobile app's API host** (`EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://vendors.fe3dr.com/api/v1` + BFF auth routes). Only the web UI dies — API/auth-bff routing on that host MUST keep serving. Same check for any API traffic on the other hosts before removal.
- [ ] **auth-bff registry cleanup** — drop the dead web app entries (`web`, `vendor-portal`, `delivery-portal` blocks in `apps/auth-bff/homechef-products.yaml`) once portals are gone; keep mobile-facing entries.
- [ ] **Repo cleanup** — archive/delete the three web app dirs + their CI; update README + monorepo docs.
- **Sequencing:** build the landing now; flip DNS/routing only after both store listings are live (a landing with dead store links is worse than the current web app).
- **Decision (owner, 2026-06-10):** customer web ordering dies entirely — app-only (Uber model), fewer apps to manage. All three web apps (`web`, `vendor-portal`, `delivery-portal`) sunset; the landing page is the only web surface.

### 5B. Tesserix platform integration (mark8ly pattern)

Reference: mark8ly's registration spans 4 touchpoints. Home Chef replicates each:

- [ ] **Platform auth-bff `products.yaml`** (`tesserix-new/auth-bff/products.yaml`) — add `homechef` product entry (domain `fe3dr.com`). GIP tenants already exist (`HomeChef-Customer-rqg8a`, `HomeChef-Business-8s8ql`) — reference them; do NOT create new ones.
  - **Open decision:** Home-Chef-App currently runs its OWN auth-bff with `homechef-products.yaml`. Mobile apps depend on it — keep it serving mobile; the platform registry entry is for tesserix-home admin visibility/SSO only. Full auth-bff consolidation is a separate (deferrable) effort.
- [ ] **`tesserix-infra/services.yaml`** — register Home Chef services under `appGroup: homechef` (namespace, storageApps, usesGoShared) so deploy tooling + monitoring see them.
- [ ] **tesserix-home product config** — add `homechef: ProductConfig` to `lib/products/configs.ts` REGISTRY: id/name/namespace/cluster + KPI tiles (active chefs, orders today, GMV, pending approvals) + rowCountTables mapped to homechef DB tables.
- [ ] **tesserix-home UI** — `app/admin/apps/homechef/page.tsx` (one-liner via `getProductConfig("homechef")`), add `hcNav` to `sidebar.tsx` + extend `getActiveContext()`, add `/homechef-icon.png` asset. Products-grid already has a homechef stub — wire it to the real page.
- [ ] **OpenFGA stores** — register `hc-internal` / `hc-customer` stores via `go-shared/authz` MultiStoreClient at service startup if/when homechef services adopt platform FGA checks _(optional for v1 — current JWT role model keeps working; flag as fast-follow)_.
- [ ] **Chef payout/settlement management (admin)** — surface **all-chef** payouts in tesserix-home (view + configure). Done in the same batch as the rest of tesserix-home integration.
  - **Backend prereqs (homechef-api):** admin endpoints to list all `WeeklyStatement`s (filter week/chef/status), per-chef net-payout + bank/UPI + status; configure commission % (`platform_settings.service_fee_percent`) + payout schedule; mark-paid + bulk-CSV export. Add `status / paidAt / payoutRef` to `WeeklyStatement` (no status field today).
  - **Already shipped:** weekly settlement **calculation** is automated (`statement_cron.go` → idempotent Mon–Sun IST statements w/ commission + CGST/SGST/IGST + TDS + NetPayout). Chef self-service view + receipt/invoice PDF is live in the vendor app.
  - **Disbursement gated** on RazorpayX + an Indian entity (see payment-structuring decision: stick with Razorpay, Indian subsidiary deferred, low volume). Until then payouts are computed weekly and **paid manually**; the RazorpayX auto-payout adapter (cron → createPayout per pending statement → webhook marks paid) is a fast-follow once the entity lands.
- [ ] **Delivery (3PL) admin in tesserix-home** — manage delivery providers (config/keys/toggle/test), view delivery list + stats, and **reconcile 3PL costs vs collected delivery fees** (admin CRUD already exists at `/admin/delivery/providers`). See Wave 7E.
- [ ] **Customer-ops oversight in tesserix-home** — orders/GMV/customers KPI tiles + read access to customer-side ops data (already part of the homechef product config KPIs above).
- **Known friction (from mark8ly audit):** sidebar nav arrays + icon assets + per-product route dir are hardcoded — 3–4 file edits, no architectural blocker; "marketplace" strings leak in a couple of shared components.

### Definition of done
- `fe3dr.com` renders the landing with working store links on mobile + desktop; old portal URLs 301 to it; the vendor mobile app's API calls are unaffected (smoke: login + dashboard fetch from a device after DNS flip)
- Home Chef tile appears in tesserix-home products grid → opens a working product overview with live KPI tiles
- Platform admin can reach Home Chef ops data without leaving tesserix-home

### Parallelization
- Subagent A: landing page build (can start immediately)
- Subagent B: tesserix-home + registries (separate repos — needs a session in `tesserix-new/` root, not Home-Chef-App)
- DNS/routing flip + portal teardown: by hand, after store approval

---

## Wave 6 — Customer app production close-out (separate session)

**Goal:** the customer ordering app is launch-ready alongside the vendor app.

**Status:** Phase-02 verified **feature-complete** (11/11 CUST requirements, no stubs/TODO blockers). Shipped this session (2026-06-11): address fetch/create + **address labels** + **per-item special instructions**; **in-app Razorpay payment** (Standard Checkout in a WebView, server-side verify — replaces the external-browser flow, adds `react-native-webview`); **legal screens** (Refund/Terms/Privacy); order-shape mapper + **chef-on-orders** API field (deployed); place-order crash fix + **error surfacing**; **18 misconfigured delivery zones deactivated** to unblock ordering.

### Pending
- [ ] **Live driver location on the tracking map** — `DeliveryResponse.ToResponse()` omits driver + dropoff coords, so the map falls back to chef location. **Resolved by Wave 7** (3PL webhooks carry rider location → surface in `DeliveryResponse` → map goes live). No own-driver fix needed given fleet retirement.
- [ ] **Payment happy-path verification** — real cart → Razorpay **test card** (`4111 1111 1111 1111`) → success, tapped through on device. Then switch `rzp_test_*`→`rzp_live_*` in `homechef-api-secrets` and register the **live Razorpay webhook** at `https://api.fe3dr.com/webhooks/razorpay` (backend handler verified live; dashboard config is owner action).
- [ ] **Surface Privacy in the UI** — add a Profile → Legal section (Terms · Privacy · Refund). `/privacy` route exists but isn't linked anywhere; `/refund` + `/terms` are linked from checkout. (~30 min)

- [ ] **Customer unit tests** — planned-but-unwritten: `cart-store`, `useOrderTracking`, `useChefs`, jest RN setup.
- [ ] **EAS production build + App Store submission** (customer track; separate from vendor) — blocked on Apple Developer enrollment (same blocker as vendor).
- [ ] **Delivery zones** — currently OFF (ordering unrestricted). Re-enable only if coverage enforcement is wanted, and only after adding real zone bounding boxes + address **coordinate capture** (`expo-location`, not installed).

## Wave 7 — Delivery via 3PL providers (Shadowfax-class) + own-fleet retirement

**Decision (owner, 2026-06-11):** Home Chef will **not run its own delivery fleet** — managing delivery agents is overkill at this scale. Deliveries are fulfilled by **third-party logistics providers** (Shadowfax / Dunzo / Porter class). The **own delivery app (`apps/mobile-delivery`) + own-fleet backend are retired.** Mirrors the web-sunset decision: fewer surfaces to operate.

### 7A. Retire own-fleet
- [ ] **Sunset `apps/mobile-delivery`** + the web `delivery-portal` (already in Wave 5A). Archive dirs + CI; `delivery.fe3dr.com` web routes 301 → landing.
- [ ] **Deprecate own-driver code paths** (keep DB tables until data is irrelevant): driver onboarding (`/delivery/onboarding/*`), `DriverOnboardingPayout`, driver Stripe Connect (`CreateDriverStripeAccount`), `DeliveryPartner` self-service, `ManualAssignDelivery`. Make admin "delivery partners" views read-only or remove.
- ⚠️ Confirm nothing API-critical rides `delivery.fe3dr.com` before teardown (same caution as the vendor host in 5A).

### 7B. 3PL integration — what EXISTS (framework, scaffolded ✅)
- `models.DeliveryProvider` — full config: name/code (Dunzo/Porter/**Shadowfax**), `APIBaseURL/APIKey/APISecret/WebhookSecret`, `StatusMapping` (provider→Fe3dr `DeliveryStatus`), `SupportedCities/Countries`, `MaxDistance`, `PricingModel` + `BaseCost` (what Fe3dr pays per delivery).
- Admin CRUD: `/admin/delivery/providers` — List/Get/Create/Update/Delete/Toggle/**TestConnection**/Stats (`handlers/delivery_provider.go`).
- Inbound webhook: `POST /webhooks/delivery/:provider` — HMAC-verified (`X-Webhook-Signature`), `services.HandleProviderWebhook(code, body)` maps provider status → `DeliveryStatus`.

### 7C. 3PL integration — what's MISSING (build this)
- [ ] **Per-provider OUTBOUND adapter** (start with **Shadowfax**) — a `DeliveryProviderClient` interface keyed by `provider.Code` with `CreateTask` (pickup=chef, drop=customer), `CancelTask`, `GetQuote`, `TrackTask`; provider-specific auth + payload mapping. Lives alongside `services/provider.go`.
- [ ] **Serviceability + quote at checkout** — replace the flat `policy.BaseDeliveryFee` (`orders.go:173`) with a live 3PL quote (fee + ETA) for the customer's address; fall back to flat fee if the provider is down/out-of-area.
- [ ] **Auto-dispatch** — on order ready/accepted, call the selected provider's `CreateTask`; persist `provider_id` + external task id on the `Delivery` row. Provider selection by serviceable city + cost.
- [ ] **Tracking → closes the Wave-6 live-map gap** — provider webhooks carry rider status + **live location**; persist driver/dropoff coords and **surface them in `DeliveryResponse.ToResponse()`** so the customer map shows the real rider.
- [ ] **Cancellation** — order cancel → provider `CancelTask`; reconcile any 3PL cancellation fee.

### 7D. Delivery payments & payouts (3PL model — much simpler than own-fleet)
- **Customer side:** delivery fee (3PL quote) is collected in the order total via Razorpay — **no change to the customer payment rail.**
- **Platform → 3PL settlement:** Fe3dr pays the provider per `PricingModel`/`BaseCost`, typically a **prepaid wallet** or **postpaid weekly invoice** with the 3PL. **No per-driver payouts** — that entire complexity disappears with the fleet. Reconcile collected delivery fees vs 3PL charges (margin/subsidy).
  - ⚠️ Same constraint as chef payouts: paying an Indian 3PL needs **INR funded from an Indian account/entity** (see payment-structuring decision). At low volume, top up the 3PL wallet manually from the interim entity account; automate later.
- **Tax:** capture the 3PL's GST tax invoice for input credit (entity-dependent).

### 7E. tesserix-home admin (batches with Wave 5B)
- [ ] Manage delivery providers (config/keys/toggle/test), view delivery list + stats, **reconcile 3PL cost vs collected delivery fee**. Built in the single tesserix-home integration effort alongside chef-payout admin (5B).

### Definition of done
- A customer order **auto-dispatches to Shadowfax**, the customer sees the **real rider** move on the live map, status flows pickup→delivered via webhook, and the platform's 3PL cost is recorded + reconcilable — with **zero own-fleet code in the hot path**.
