# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-05)

**Core value:** Customers can browse home chefs, order food, and track delivery on their phones — while chefs manage orders and drivers navigate deliveries natively.
**Current focus:** Phase 04 — GPS, Push + Polish

## Current Position

Phase: 04
Plan: Not started
Status: Executing Phase 04
Last activity: 2026-06-17 - Completed quick task 260617-mh6: DPDP export/delete tests (#12); branch test/dpdp-export-delete-issue-12, PR pending

Session continuity (2026-06-17 pm): repo `tesserix/Home-Chef-App` made **PUBLIC** (to get free GitHub Actions — org Actions billing was blocking all CI). Deployed `auth-bff` (registry cleanup) + `api` (social-profile/email_verified) via the CI→GHCR→tesserix-k8s argocd bump→ArgoCD chain — required refreshing the expired `TESSERIX_K8S_BOT` PAT (see reference_deploy_pipeline_and_repo_public memory). Going public unleashed Dependabot: **auto-merge PAUSED** (`dependabot-auto-merge.yml` disabled) after it merged a partial expo-updates 56 bump. SDK 56 upgrade done on local main but **NOT pushed** — owner must run a native build (Xcode ≥26.4) first, then push. Redundant dependabot expo-* PRs to close: #79/#84/#85/#86/#87. Android prod builds (customer e6bcc99e + vendor 8c868fa3, versionCode 2) submitted to Play internal earlier. iOS #9 closed (TestFlight launch verified).

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: Use raw FCM tokens (`getDevicePushTokenAsync`) not Expo Push Tokens — existing `push.go` calls FCM directly and the two token types are incompatible
- Phase 1: Must verify `@tesserix/native` peer deps and current Expo SDK stable version (52 vs 53) before pinning versions — do not scaffold until confirmed
- Phase 1: Each app needs `metro.config.js` with `watchFolders` and `resolver.nodeModulesPaths` — pnpm symlinks are invisible to Metro by default
- Phase 1: GPS location watcher must use `distanceInterval: 20–50m` and `timeInterval: 5–10s` to avoid flooding `db-f1-micro` (architectural constraint)
- Phase 4: Background location permission must be gated on driver going online, not on first launch — App Store rejection risk otherwise

### Pending Todos

- Dark mode for mobile apps (from 2026-06-10 vendor UX critique): `.impeccable.md` requires "light-first, dark supported" but `packages/mobile-shared/src/theme/tokens.ts` has no dark palette and all screens use static StyleSheets. Phase-sized: dark token set + theme-reactive styling across all 3 apps. Promote via /gsd-add-phase.
- Bulk availability toggle for vendor menu categories (from same critique) — needs UX decision on placement.

| 260617-mp6 | Fix vendor "~48 lucide type errors" — root cause was NOT lucide drift: `apps/mobile-vendor/types/expo-modules.d.ts` was a hand-written `declare module` stub file ("packages not yet in node_modules") that, post-SDK-56, **shadowed** the real installed types; its lucide stub declared only 16 icons → every other icon `TS2305`. All 5 stubbed pkgs now installed w/ real types → deleted the obsolete file (−139). Vendor tsc **48→5**; the 5 remainders are pre-existing `expo-router` TS2345 from a stale auto-generated `.expo/types/router.d.ts` (regenerates at build; on main too). Customer/delivery had no stub.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **✅ RESOLVED on-device (2026-06-16): iOS launch crash + Google Sign-In + Apple Sign-In.** All three verified working on a local signed device build (iPhone 17 Pro), both apps. Arch-mismatch theory was WRONG (RN 0.83 is new-arch-only; `newArchEnabled` no-op). Fixes: (1) **launch crash** resolved in current code (crashed TestFlight builds were an older commit; sim couldn't reproduce). (2) **Google Sign-In** — stale pre-migration iOS OAuth client IDs in `.env.local` didn't match `GoogleService-Info.plist`/URL scheme; FIX commit dda168e: aligned `.env.local` iosClientId, added `@react-native-google-signin/google-signin` plugin `iosUrlScheme` to both app.json, added Google client IDs + `GIP_API_KEY` to `eas.json` production env. (3) **Apple Sign-In** — was `auth/operation-not-allowed`; FIX = enabled Apple provider in both GIP tenants (HomeChef-Customer-rqg8a + HomeChef-Business-8s8ql; iOS platform + bundle ID, server-side, no app change). **EAS production build #3 (vendor `fe77a977` + customer `3c45c479`) submitted to TestFlight** (carries launch+Google fixes; Apple works via the now-enabled GIP provider). REMAINING: confirm build #3 from TestFlight; run Android via `release.yml`. Detail in `project_ios_launch_crash_debug` + `project_apple_signin_gip_not_enabled` memories.

- **Sentry source-map upload (vendor) DISABLED** via `SENTRY_DISABLE_AUTO_UPLOAD=true` — EU-region (`tesserix` org, `de.sentry.io`) + sentry-cli/Expo-gradle can't reconcile control-silo auth (sentry.io) vs EU data region: `SENTRY_URL=de`→401 invalid token, no `SENTRY_URL`→"organization not found". Runtime crash reporting via DSN is UNAFFECTED. **Post-launch follow-up:** re-enable upload with correct EU endpoint config (or a region-matched token) for de-minified stack traces.
- Confirm Go API has `PATCH /v1/delivery/:id/location` endpoint before Phase 4 GPS work begins
- Confirm whether real-time driver location for Customer map is REST polling or WebSocket (v1 fallback: 5-second polling)
- Verify EAS Build free tier build minute limits for 3 apps before Phase 1 ends

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-06-16 — iOS auth debugging
Stopped at: all iOS auth fixed on-device (launch + Google + Apple Sign-In); EAS prod build #3 submitted to TestFlight (vendor `fe77a977` + customer `3c45c479`)

Next session TODO:
1. Confirm TestFlight build #3 (both apps) once Apple processing finishes — verify launch + Google + Apple sign-in from TestFlight on-device.
2. Ship Android: `eas workflow:run release.yml` (or `eas build -p android --profile production --auto-submit`) per app — same Google client-ID fixes already in `eas.json` apply.
3. Account linking by email across password/Google/Apple — backend/identity work, see `project_account_linking_by_email` memory (outside mobile "no backend changes" scope; needs scoping).
4. Local-build reminder: build locally for SIM/device only, no EAS during debug (see `feedback_local_sim_builds_only`); device builds need `SENTRY_DISABLE_AUTO_UPLOAD=true` for vendor + ad-hoc sign for sim.

Key context memories: `project_ios_launch_crash_debug`, `project_apple_signin_gip_not_enabled`, `reference_apple_eas_identifiers`.
